We plan to create a website that simulates a job application, job posting and job search.
To carry out this project, we have chosen HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front and node.js for back end as our coding languages.
For the database, we used Docker Desktop to share a working environment that allows communication between the diferent images we needed.
For the database, we have decided to use PostgreSQL, an open source database renowned for its reliability.
